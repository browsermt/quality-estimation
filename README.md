# Quality estimation

This repository contains scripts to fit feature-based quality estimation model. For this to work in a reproducible way,
you first need to create a conda environment:

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Once conda env is created, activate it by running `conda activate qe`. After that run `pip install .` 
to install the package.

Once the installation is completed, you can run `scripts/run.sh` to produce the models.
